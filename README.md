# libgdx-playground
This project is a designated sandbox for me to record my progress as I work through the book *Java Game Development with 
LibGDX* by Lee Semkoski. This book was acquired through a past Humble Bundle, but is also available at 
https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484233238 if someone were inclined to follow along and figure out what I'm doing.
